Theories, models and frameworks| Are used to inform and inspire design
A theory is |a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon
A model is| a simplification of some aspect of human–computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs
A framework is |a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions
Theories tend to be |comprehensive, explaining human–computer interactions
Models tend to |simplify some aspect of human–computer interaction
Frameworks tend to be |prescriptive, providing designers with concepts, questions, and principles to consider
Need to have a good understanding of the problem space|specifying what it is you aredoing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended
A conceptual model is ahigh-level description of a product|what users can do with it and the concepts they need to understand how to interact with it
Decisions about conceptual design should be| made before commencing any physical design
Interface metaphors are| commonly used as part of a conceptual model
We need to |take into account cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of users
We can provide knowledge about |what users can and cannot be expected to do
Identify and explain the nature and causes of problems users encounter|Why do we need to understand users
Supply theories, modelling tools, guidance and methods that can| lead to the design of better interactive products
Core cognitive aspects| Attention, Perception and recognition, Memory, Reading, speaking and listening, Problem-solving, planning, reasoning and decision-making, learning
Core cognitive aspects|Most relevant to interaction design are attention,perception and recognition, and memory
Allows us to focus on information that is| relevant to what we are doing- Attention
Involves audio and/or visual senses| Attention
Selecting things to concentrate on at a point| in time from the mass of stimuli around us- Attention
Focussed and divided attention enables us to be| selective in terms of the mass of competing stimuli but limits our ability to keep track of all events- Attention
Information at the interface should be structured to capture users’ attention| e.g. use perceptual boundaries (windows),colour, reverse video, sound and flashing lights- Attention
Tullis (1987)| found that the two screens produced quite different results
Make information salient |when it needs attending to-Design implications for attention
Use techniques that make things stand out| like colour, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing and animation-Design implications for attention
Avoid cluttering the| interface - follow the google.com example of crisp, simple design-Design implications for attention
Avoid using too much because| the software allows it-Design implications for attention
Representations of information need to be |designed to be perceptible and recognizable- Design implications
Icons and other graphical representations should enable| users to readily distinguish their meaning- Design implications
Bordering and spacing are |effective visual ways of grouping information- Design implications
Sounds should be |audible and distinguishable- Design implications
Speech output should enable |users to distinguish between the set of spoken words- Design implications
Text should be |legible and distinguishable from the background- Design implications
Involves first |encoding and then retrieving knowledge- Memory
We don’t remember |everything - involves filtering and processing what is attended to- Memory
Context is |important in affecting our memory (i.e., where, when)- Memory
Well known fact that we recognize things much better than being able to recall things|Better at remembering images than words, Why interfaces are largely visual- Memory
Encoding is first stage of memory|determines which information is attended to in the environment and how it is interpreted- Processing in memory
The more attention paid to something|Processing in memory
And the more it is processed in terms of thinking about it and comparing it with other knowledge|Processing in memory
Context affects the extent to |which information can be subsequently retrieved
Sometimes it can be difficult for people to |recall information that was encoded in a different context
Command-based interfaces require users to| recall from memory a name from a possible set of 100s- Recognition versus recall
GUIs provide visually-based options that users need only| browse through until they recognize one- Recognition versus recall
Web browsers, MP3 players, etc., provide lists of visited URLs, song titles etc.,| that support recognition memory- Recognition versus recall
Personal information management (PIM) is a growing problem for most users| Who have vast numbers of documents, images, music files, video clips, emails, attachments, bookmarks, etc.,
Major problem is| deciding where and how to save them all, then remembering what they were called and where to find them again
Naming most| common means of encoding them
Memory involves 2 processes|recall-directed and recognition-based scanning
File management systems should be designed to optimize both kinds of memory processes|e.g., Search box and history list
Help users encode files in richer ways|Provide them with ways of saving files using colour, flagging, image, flexible text, time stamping, etc
Don’t overload users’ memories with| complicated procedures for carrying out tasks- Design implications
Design interfaces that| promote recognition rather than recall- Design implications
Provide users with a variety of ways of encoding digital information to| help them remember where they have stored them| e.g., categories, color, flagging, time stamping- Design implications
Users develop an understanding of a system through| learning and using it- Mental models
Knowledge is often described as a mental model|How to use the system (what to do next), What to do with unfamiliar systems or unexpected situations (how the system works)- Mental models
People make inferencesusing mental models of |how to carry out tasks- Mental models
Craik (1943) described mental models as |internal constructions of some aspect of the external world enabling predictions to be made- Mental models
Involves unconscious and conscious processes, |where images and analogies are activated- Mental models
Deep versus shallow models |how to drive a car and how it works- Mental models
Many people have erroneous mental models|(Kempton, 1996)
Payne (1991) |did a similar study and found that people frequently resort to analogies to explain how they work
People’s accounts greatly varied and| were often ad hoc
Proposes 7 stages of an activity|Establish a goal, Form an intention, Specify an action sequence, Execute an action, Perceive the system state, Interpret the state, Evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions
Human activity does not| proceed in such an orderly and sequential manner
More usual for stages to be| missed, repeated or out of order
Do not always| have a clear goal in mind but react to the world
Theory is only| approximation of what happens and is greatly simplified
Help designers think about| how to help users monitor their actions
The ‘gulfs’ explicate the gaps that exist |between the user and the interface
The gulf of execution|the distance from the user to the physical system while the second one

Concerned with explaining how we interact with external representations|maps, notes, diagrams- External cognition
Diaries, reminders, calendars, notes, shopping lists, to-do lists - written |to remind us of what to do- Externalizing to reduce memory load
Post-its, piles, marked emails - where placed indicates priority of| what to do- Externalizing to reduce memory load
External representations|Remind us that we need to do something (to buy something for mother’s day), Remind us of what to do (buy a card), Remind us when to do something (send a card by a certain date)
When a tool is used in conjunction with an external representation |to carry out a computation (e.g. pen and paper)- Computational offloading
Annotation involves modifying existing representations through making marks| crossing off, ticking, underlining- Annotation and cognitive tracing
Cognitive tracing involves externally manipulating items into different orders or structures |playing scrabble, playing cards- Annotation and cognitive tracing
Provide external representations at the interface that |reduce memory load and facilitate computational offloading- Design implication

Provide information about shared objects and progress of collaborative tasks|Tickertape, Babble
Elvin is| a distributed awareness system that provides a range of client services (Segall and Arnold,1997)
It includes Tickertape, one of the first lightweight messaging systems| Elvin

Many collaborative technologies systems have been built |to support collaboration
HCI has traditionally been about| designing efficient and effective systems- Affective aspects
Now more about how to design interactive systems that make people respondin certain ways|e.g. to be happy, to be trusting, to learn, to be motivated- Affective aspects
Users have created a range ofemoticonscompensate for lack of expressiveness in text communication:|Happy:),Sad:<,Sick:X,Mad>:,Very angry >:-(- User-created expressiveness
Also use of icons and shorthand in texting and instant messaging has emotional connotations, |e.g.I 12 CU 2NITE-created expressiveness
Marcus (1992)| proposed interfaces for different user groups
Left dialog box was| designed for white American females- Marcus (1992)

Right dialog box was designed for| European adult male intellectuals- Marcus (1992)
who like “suave prose, a restrained treatment of information density, and a classical approach to font selection”| Marcus (1992)

when frightened or angry we focus narrowly and body responds by tensing muscles and sweating| more likely to be less tolerant- Claims from model
when happy we are less focused and the body relaxes| more likely to overlook minor problems and be more creative- Claims from model
Jordon (2000) based on| Tiger’s (1992) framework of pleasure

Only make claims that | your data can support-Presenting the findings
The best way to present your findings depends on | the audience, the purpose, and the data gathering and analysis undertaken
Graphical representations (as discussed above) may be | appropriate for presentation
The data analysis that can be done depends on |the data gathering that was done
Qualitative and quantitative data may be gathered|from any of the three main data gathering approaches
Percentages and averages are commonly used | in Interaction Design
Mean, median and mode are different kinds of ‘average’ and can have | very different answers for the same set of data
Grounded Theory, Distributed Cognition and Activity Theory are|theoretical frameworks to support data analysis
Presentation of the findings should not|overstate the evidence
a goal-directed problem solving activity informed by |intended use, target domain, materials, cost, and feasibility
a decision-making activity | to balance trade-offs
It is a representation | a plan for development
It is a representation | a set of alternatives and successive elaborations
Realistic expectations|Expectation management-Importance of involving users
No surprises, no disappointments|Expectation management-Importance of involving users
Timely training|Expectation management-Importance of involving users
Communication, but no hype|Expectation management-Importance of involving users
Make the users active stakeholders |Ownership-Importance of involving users
More likely to forgive or accept problems|Ownership-Importance of involving users

Part time: patchy input, and very stressful|Member of the design team-Degrees of user involvement
Short term: inconsistent across project life|Member of the design team-Degrees of user involvement
Long term: consistent, but lose touch with users|Member of the design team-Degrees of user involvement
Reach wider selection of users |Newsletters and other dissemination devices
Need communication both ways |Newsletters and other dissemination devices
Users rarely know | what is possible-What are ‘needs’
Users can’t tell you what they ‘need’ |to help them achieve their goals-What are ‘needs’
Humans stick to | what they know works-Where do alternatives come from
But considering alternatives is | important to‘break out of the box’-Where do alternatives come from
Designers are | trained to consider alternatives,software people generally are not-Where do alternatives come from
Evaluation |with users or with peers, e.g. prototypes-How do you choose among alternatives
Technical feasibility | some not possible-How do you choose among alternatives
Quality thresholds| Usability goals lead to usability criteria set early on and check regularly-How do you choose among alternatives
Show how activities are | related to each other-Lifecycle models
Lifecycle models are |management tools,simplified versions of reality-Lifecycle models
The Star lifecycle model |Suggested by Hartson and Hix (1989)

Why ‘establish’ |Requirements arise from understanding users’ needs-Establishing requirements
Why ‘establish’ |Requirements can be justified & related to data-Establishing requirements
Environment or context of use | physical: dusty? noisy? vibration? light? heat?humidity
Environment or context of use |social: sharing of files, of displays, in paper,across great distances, work individually, privacy for clients
Environment or context of use |organisational: hierarchy, IT department’s attitude and remit, user support, communications structure and infrastructure, availability of training
Self-service filling and payment system for| a petrol (gas) station-Kinds of requirements
On-board ship data analysis system for| geologists searching for oil-Kinds of requirements
An approach to ethnographic study where user is| expert, designer is apprentice-Contextual Inquiry
Four main principles|Context,Partnership,Interpretation,Focus-Contextual Inquiry
Identifying and involving stakeholders|users, managers, developers, customer reps?,union reps?, shareholders
Involving stakeholders|workshops, interviews,workplace studies, co-opt stakeholders onto the development team
‘Real’ users, not managers|traditionally a problem in software engineering,but better now
Requirements management| version control,ownership
Problems with data gathering |Political problems within the organisation
Problems with data gathering |Dominance of certain stakeholders
Problems with data gathering |Economic and business environment changes
Problems with data gathering |Balancing functional and usability demands
Focus on identifying | the stakeholders’ needs-Some basic guidelines
Involve all the | stakeholder groups-Some basic guidelines

Use a combination of | data gathering techniques-Some basic guidelines
Support the process withprops such as| prototypes and task descriptions-Some basic guidelines
Run a |pilot session-Some basic guidelines
Consider carefully how to | record the data-Some basic guidelines
Start soon after | data gathering session-Data interpretation and analysis
Initial interpretation before | deeper analysis-Data interpretation and analysis
Different approaches | emphasize different elements-Data interpretation and analysis
Task descriptions are | often used to envision new systems or devices-Task analysis
Task analysis is | used mainly to investigate an existing situation-Task analysis
Many techniques, the most popular is | Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)-Task analysis
HTA focuses on physical and observable actions,and includes looking at actions | not related to software or an interaction device-Hierarchical Task Analysis
Start with a user goal which is examined and | the main tasks for achieving it are identified-Hierarchical Task Analysis
Tasks are | sub-divided into sub-tasks-Hierarchical Task Analysis
Getting requirements right | is crucial
There are different kinds of requirement, each is | significant for interaction design
Scenarios, use cases and essential use cases can be | used to articulate existing and envisioned work practices.
Task analysis techniques such as | HTA help to investigate existing systems and practices
